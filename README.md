**Tippy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Emmanuel Sarella**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if elapsed time < 10mins)
* [X] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

Manipulating Color Schemes was hard. Next time I will be using a library to have various color scheme modes.

UI polishing and wrestling with autolayout took more time than expected

Swift was fun, coming from Obj-C I had to get used to the changed syntax, Once I kept going it was very intuitive.

Excited about the Codepath course. Dreaming of gaining skills to make killer apps.
